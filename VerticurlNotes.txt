	Beyond basic data types and constraints, advanced SQL querying techniques offer powerful tools for data validation and verification. Here are some key approaches:

1. Utilizing Window Functions:

	ROW_NUMBER() and RANK(): 
		Identify and analyze specific rows within a group. 
		For example, 
			check if a customer has 
				placed more than 3 orders 
				in the last month 
			or 
				identify the top 10 products by sales.
				
				
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Differences Between ROW_NUMBER() and RANK()
		-------------------------------------------
		
			Unique Identifier vs. Rank:
				ROW_NUMBER() 
					assigns a unique number 
						to each row in the ordered partition, 
					ensuring no duplicates.
				RANK() 
					assigns the same rank to rows with equal values in the ordering criteria, and the ranks may have gaps.

			Handling of Ties:
				ROW_NUMBER() does not handle ties; each row gets a unique sequential number.
				RANK() gives the same rank to tied rows, causing gaps in the ranking sequence.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The ROW_NUMBER() function 
	assigns a unique sequential integer 
		to rows within a partition of the result set
		start at 1 for the first row in each partition.

		Syntax:


		ROW_NUMBER() OVER ([PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY sort_expression)

			PARTITION BY: 
				(Optional) Divides the result set 
					into partitions 
					ROW_NUMBER() function is applied. 
				If no partition specified
					function treats the entire result set as a single partition.
			ORDER BY: 
				Specifies the order of the rows within each partition.

		Example:

		SELECT 
			column1, 
			column2, 
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY column1) AS row_num
		FROM 
			table_name;


RANK()

		The RANK() function 
			assigns a rank to each row 
				within a partition of the result set. 
			Rows with the same values 
				in the order by clause 
					receive the same rank
				next rank is not consecutive. 
			It skips rank values to maintain the same relative rank for tied rows.

		Syntax:

		RANK() OVER ([PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY sort_expression)

			PARTITION BY: 
				(Optional) Divides the result set 
					into partitions 
					RANK() function is applied. 
			If not specified
				the function treats the entire result set as a single partition.
		ORDER BY: 
			Specifies the order of the rows within each partition.

		Example:

		SELECT 
			column1, 
			column2, 
			RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column1) AS rank
		FROM 
			table_name;
.
		
		Example Illustrating the Difference:
		-----------------------------------
		
		Assume we have the following table employees:
		employee_id	name	salary
		1	Alice			5000
		2	Bob				6000
		3	Charlie			6000
		4	David			4000

		Using ROW_NUMBER():


		SELECT 
			name, 
			salary, 
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
		FROM 
			employees;

		Result:
		name	salary	row_num
		Bob		6000	1
		Charlie	6000	2
		Alice	5000	3
		David	4000	4

		Using RANK():

		SELECT 
			name, 
			salary, 
			RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
		FROM 
			employees;

		Result:
		name	salary	rank
		Bob		6000	1
		Charlie	6000	1
		Alice	5000	3
		David	4000	4

		In the RANK() example, 
			both Bob and Charlie 
				receive the same rank of 1
			next rank is 3, 
			skipping 2. 
		In contrast, ROW_NUMBER() assigns a unique number to each row.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------				
	NTILE(): 
		Divide data into equal-sized groups. 
			analyze data distribution and 
			identify potential outliers or 
			inconsistencies.

NTILE function in MySQL 
	window function 
	divides rows in a result set 
		into a specified number of approximately equal groups, or "tiles". 
	assigns each row a number 
		representing the tile to which the row belongs. 
	advantage
	---------
		distribute rows into different groups 
			for further analysis or processing.

Syntax

NTILE(n) OVER ([PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY sort_expression)

    n: 
		The number of tiles (groups) to divide the result set into.
    PARTITION BY: 
		(Optional) Divides the result set into partitions to which the NTILE function is applied. If not specified, the function treats the entire result set as a single partition.
    ORDER BY: 
		Specifies the order of the rows within each partition. The NTILE function assigns tile numbers based on this order.


Consider the following table employees:
employee_id	name	salary
1			Alice	5000
2			Bob		6000
3			Charlie	4000
4			David	4500
5			Eve		7000
6			Frank	5500

Using NTILE to Divide into 2 Tiles

sql

SELECT 
    name, 
    salary, 
    NTILE(2) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS tile
FROM 
    employees;

Result:
name	salary	tile
Eve		7000	1
Bob		6000	1
Frank	5500	1
Alice	5000	2
David	4500	2
Charlie	4000	2

In this example, 
	NTILE(2) function 
		divides the rows into two tiles 
			based on the salary in descending order. 
	The first three rows fall into tile 1
		remaining rows fall into tile 2.

Using NTILE to Divide into 3 Tiles


SELECT 
    name, 
    salary, 
    NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS tile
FROM 
    employees;

Result:
name	salary	tile
Eve		7000	1
Bob		6000	1
Frank	5500	2
Alice	5000	2
David	4500	3
Charlie	4000	3

In this example, the NTILE(3) function divides the rows into three tiles. The first two rows fall into tile 1, the next two into tile 2, and the last two into tile 3.
Practical Use Cases

    Performance Analysis:
        You can divide employees into performance groups based on their scores or ratings.

    Salary Distribution:
        Group employees into different salary bands to analyze salary distribution.

    Sales Analysis:
        Divide sales data into quantiles to analyze the distribution of sales figures.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
																															2. Leveraging Subqueries and Joins:

	Subqueries within WHERE clause: 
		Validate data based on conditions within other tables. 
		For example
			ensure a customer's email address 
				exists in the registered users table 
				before allowing them to place an order.
	Self-joins: 
		Identify duplicate records. 
		crucial for 
			data integrity and 
			preventing errors.
			
3. Advanced Data Type Checks:

	Regular Expressions (REGEX): 
		Validate data against 
			specific patterns. 
		For example, 
			ensure email addresses follow a valid format or phone numbers adhere to a specific country code.
			
		email 
		-------
		SELECT 
			email,
			CASE
				WHEN email REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$' THEN 'Valid'
				ELSE 'Invalid'
			END AS email_status
		FROM 
			your_table_name;	
			
		phone
		-----
		SELECT 
			phone_number,
			CASE
				WHEN phone_number REGEXP '^\+?[0-9]{1,3}?[-. ]?([0-9]{3}[-. ]?){2}[0-9]{4}$' THEN 'Valid'
				ELSE 'Invalid'
			END AS phone_status
		FROM 
			your_table_name;
			
-----------------------
Using regular expressions (regex) in MySQL to validate email addresses and phone numbers can be very useful for ensuring that the data meets specific format requirements. MySQL provides the REGEXP operator for matching strings against a regex pattern. Here are examples of how to use regex to validate email addresses and phone numbers in MySQL.
Email Validation

A basic regex pattern to validate email addresses can check for the general structure: username@domain.tld. The following regex pattern ensures that:

    The username part can contain letters, numbers, dots, underscores, and hyphens.
    The domain part can contain letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens.
    The top-level domain (TLD) is 2 to 6 characters long and contains only letters.

Regex Pattern:

regex

^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$

MySQL Query:

sql

SELECT 
    email,
    CASE
        WHEN email REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$' THEN 'Valid'
        ELSE 'Invalid'
    END AS email_status
FROM 
    your_table_name;

Phone Number Validation

A basic regex pattern to validate phone numbers can vary greatly depending on the expected format. A common format might include:

    An optional country code starting with a + followed by 1-3 digits.
    A space or hyphen separator.
    A sequence of digits, possibly separated by spaces or hyphens.

Regex Pattern:

regex

^\+?[0-9]{1,3}?[-. ]?([0-9]{3}[-. ]?){2}[0-9]{4}$

This pattern allows:

    An optional + followed by 1 to 3 digits for the country code.
    Optional separators like spaces, hyphens, or dots.
    The main part of the number split into groups of digits, typically in the form xxx-xxx-xxxx.

MySQL Query:

sql

SELECT 
    phone_number,
    CASE
        WHEN phone_number REGEXP '^\+?[0-9]{1,3}?[-. ]?([0-9]{3}[-. ]?){2}[0-9]{4}$' THEN 'Valid'
        ELSE 'Invalid'
    END AS phone_status
FROM 
    your_table_name;

Explanation of the Patterns

Email Regex Explanation:

    ^: Asserts the start of the string.
    [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+: Matches one or more characters that are alphanumeric or any of ._%+-.
    @: Matches the @ symbol.
    [a-zA-Z0-9.-]+: Matches one or more characters that are alphanumeric or any of .-.
    \.: Escapes the dot, matching a literal dot.
    [a-zA-Z]{2,6}: Matches between 2 and 6 letters.
    $: Asserts the end of the string.

Phone Number Regex Explanation:

    ^: Asserts the start of the string.
    \+?: Matches an optional +.
    [0-9]{1,3}?: Matches 1 to 3 digits for the country code, if present.
    [-. ]?: Matches an optional separator (space, hyphen, or dot).
    ([0-9]{3}[-. ]?){2}: Matches two groups of 3 digits each, with optional separators.
    [0-9]{4}: Matches 4 digits at the end of the string.
    $: Asserts the end of the string.

These regex patterns and MySQL queries provide a basic way to validate email addresses and phone numbers. Depending on the specific requirements and allowed formats, you might need to adjust the patterns accordingly.

------------------			
			
			
	CHECK Constraints: 
		Define custom validation rules using Boolean expressions. 
		This allows for more complex checks beyond basic data types.
		
		email
		-----
		CREATE TABLE users (
			user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
			email VARCHAR(255),
			phone_number VARCHAR(20),
			CONSTRAINT chk_email CHECK (email REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$')
		);

		phone
		-----
		CREATE TABLE users (
			user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
			email VARCHAR(255),
			phone_number VARCHAR(20),
			CONSTRAINT chk_email CHECK (email REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$'),
			CONSTRAINT chk_phone CHECK (phone_number REGEXP '^\\+?[0-9]{1,3}?[-. ]?([0-9]{3}[-. ]?){2}[0-9]{4}$')
		);
		

4. Utilizing Triggers and Stored Procedures:

	Triggers: 
		Automate data validation checks before or after data insertion or updates. 
		This ensures data integrity is maintained even during bulk operations.
	Stored Procedures: 
		Encapsulate complex validation logic for reusability and maintainability. 
		This helps centralize data validation rules and simplifies their application.

Examples:

	Identifying duplicate email addresses:

		SELECT email, COUNT(*) AS count
		FROM customers
		GROUP BY email
		HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
	.

Validating phone numbers with a specific country code:

	SELECT phone_number
	FROM customers
	WHERE phone_number NOT REGEXP '^\+1[0-9]{10}$';
.

Checking if a customer exists before placing an order:

	SELECT *
	FROM orders
	WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
		SELECT customer_id
		FROM customers
	);
.

Additional Considerations:

	Data Quality Tools: 
		Specialized data quality tools for 
			comprehensive data validation and 
			cleansing.
	Documentation: 
		Document your data validation 
			rules 
			procedures 
				for clarity and maintainability.
	Regular Reviews: 
		Regularly review 
			update your data validation processes 
				to ensure they remain effective.
	By combining these advanced techniques, you can significantly enhance data validation and verification within your SQL environment, ensuring data accuracy and consistency for reliable analysis and decision-making.
		
	
	
lab
---

 select the id, name, and a row number for each user, ordered by age in descending order. The row number starts from 1 and increments by 1 for each row.

	SELECT
	  id,
	  name,
	  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) AS row_num
	FROM users;



select the id, name, and a rank for each student, ordered by score in descending order. The rank is assigned based on the order, with the highest score getting rank 1, the second-highest score getting rank 2

	SELECT
	  id,
	  name,
	  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
	FROM students;	




select the id, name, and a salary tier for each employee, ordered by salary in descending order. The employees are divided into 3 tiers (NTILE(3)) based on their salary, with the highest earners in the first tier, the next highest in the second tier

SELECT
  id,
  name,
  NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_tier
FROM employees;




You can use PARTITION BY clause with these functions to group the data and calculate the row number, rank, or NTILE within each group.
You can also use these functions with other window functions like SUM() or AVG() to perform calculations based on the window of data.

	---------------------------------------------------------------------
	Â· Working with complex joins, subqueries, and window functions
	---------------------------------------------------------------------
	Working with complex joins, subqueries, and window functions requires a deep understanding of their functionalities and how they can be combined to achieve specific goals. Here are some key points to consider:

	Complex Joins:

		Multiple Join Types: Combining different join types (inner, left, right, full) can create complex relationships between multiple tables. Understanding the nuances of each join type and how they interact is crucial for accurate results.
	Join Conditions: 
		Complex joins often involve multiple join conditions, specifying how rows from different tables should be matched. Ensure the conditions are logically sound and avoid ambiguity.
	Performance Optimization: 
		Complex joins can be computationally expensive. Consider using proper indexing and query optimization techniques to improve performance.

Examples:

Finding customers who haven't placed an order in the last 6 months:


CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL,
  order_date DATE NOT NULL,
  order_status VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  -- Add other relevant columns here, such as:
  -- total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
  -- shipping_address VARCHAR(255),
  CONSTRAINT fk_customer_id FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);


INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe'),
(2, 'Jane Smith'),
(3, 'Alice Johnson'),
(4, 'Bob Brown'),
(5, 'Charlie Davis');

INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, order_status) VALUES
(1, '2023-01-15', 'Completed'),
(1, '2023-02-20', 'Pending'),
(2, '2023-01-18', 'Completed'),
(3, '2023-01-25', 'Shipped'),
(4, '2023-02-10', 'Pending'),
(5, '2023-02-15', 'Completed'),
(2, '2023-03-05', 'Shipped'),
(3, '2023-03-10', 'Pending'),
(4, '2023-03-15', 'Completed'),
(5, '2023-03-20', 'Shipped');

	SELECT c.customer_id, c.name
	FROM customers c
	LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
	WHERE o.order_date IS NULL
	OR o.order_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH);













--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifying products with the highest average order quantity in each category:


add script for products 

	SELECT p.product_name, c.category_name, AVG(o.quantity) AS avg_quantity
	FROM products p
	INNER JOIN product_categories pc ON p.product_id = pc.product_id
	INNER JOIN categories c ON pc.category_id = c.category_id
	INNER JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
	INNER JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
	GROUP BY p.product_id, c.category_id
	ORDER BY avg_quantity DESC;



Subqueries:

	Nested Queries: 
		Subqueries allow you to embed one query within another, enabling complex data filtering and manipulation.
	Correlated Subqueries: 
		These subqueries reference data from the outer query, allowing for dynamic filtering and calculations based on the outer query's results.
	Performance Considerations: 
		Subqueries can sometimes impact performance. Analyze the query plan and consider alternative approaches if necessary.

Examples:

Finding employees with a salary higher than the average salary in their department:

	SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.salary
	FROM employees e
	WHERE e.salary > (
		SELECT AVG(salary)
		FROM employees
		WHERE department_id = e.department_id
	);

Identifying customers who have placed orders in the last month and have a specific product in their cart:

	SELECT c.customer_id, c.name
	FROM customers c
	WHERE c.customer_id IN (
		SELECT customer_id
		FROM orders
		WHERE order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
	)
	AND c.customer_id IN (
		SELECT customer_id
		FROM cart_items
		WHERE product_id = 123
	);


Window Functions:

Aggregating and Analyzing Data: Window functions perform calculations on a "window" of data, defined by partitioning and ordering clauses.
Common Window Functions: 
	ROW_NUMBER(), 
	RANK(), 
	LAG(), 
	LEAD(), 
	NTILE(), 
	
	
	ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns a sequential number to each row, starting from 1.
	RANK(): Assigns a rank to each row based on the specified column (in descending order by default).
	NTILE(): Divides the data into equal-sized groups (or "tiles") based on the specified column and assigns a label to each group.
	
	
	
	LAG() and LEAD() are window functions in MySQL used to access the preceding and succeeding values of a specified column within a window (or partition) of rows.

Here's a breakdown of each:

LAG():

	Retrieves the value from the previous row for a specified column.
Syntax:

LAG(expression, offset, default) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ...]
    [ORDER BY order_expression [ASC|DESC], ...]
)

Parameters:
	expression: The column or expression to retrieve the value for.
	offset: (Optional) The number of rows to look back (default is 1).
	default: (Optional) The value to return if there is no previous row (default is NULL).
LEAD():

Retrieves the value from the succeeding row for a specified column.

LEAD(expression, offset, default) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ...]
    [ORDER BY order_expression [ASC|DESC], ...]
)
.

Parameters:
expression: The column or expression to retrieve the value for.
offset: (Optional) The number of rows to look ahead (default is 1).
default: (Optional) The value to return if there is no succeeding row (default is NULL).
Key Points:

Both LAG() and LEAD() require an ORDER BY clause to define the order of the rows within the window.
The PARTITION BY clause (optional) allows you to group the data and calculate the LAG/LEAD within each group.
These functions are useful for various tasks like:
Calculating differences between consecutive values.
Implementing moving averages or other time-series calculations.
Identifying gaps or patterns in data.
Example:

SQL
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  LAG(score, 1, 0) AS previous_score,
  LEAD(score, 1, 0) AS next_score
FROM students
ORDER BY id;
.

This query will select the id, name, and the previous and next scores for each student, ordered by their id.

I hope this explanation clarifies LAG() and LEAD()!
